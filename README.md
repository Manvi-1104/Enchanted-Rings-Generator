# EngagementRingAI: Precision Ring Image Generator
An AI-based text-to-image generator

## Overview

**EngagementRingAI: Precision Ring Image Generator** is an AI-based text-to-image generator specifically fine-tuned to create high-quality images of engagement rings based on user input. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, this application is designed to provide detailed and customized visuals for various ring designs.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Convert text descriptions into realistic images of engagement rings.
- **Fine-Tuned Model**: Utilizes a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned on a specialized dataset of engagement rings.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface built with Flask and enhanced with a user-friendly frontend.
- **Keyword Filtering**: Only relevant and accurate descriptions are processed.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EngagementRingAI.git
    cd EngagementRingAI
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Download the fine-tuned model:**
    Ensure you have the fine-tuned model files in the specified path (`/path/to/fine-tuned-model`).

4. **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the application runs, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser. You will see an interface where you can input a description of the engagement ring you want to generate.

- **Input your description**: Describe the ring you want, including details like shape, design, and materials (e.g., "A round engagement ring with a classic design").
- **Generate Image**: Click the "Generate Image" button to see the generated image based on your description.
- **View Results**: The generated image will be displayed below the input box.
